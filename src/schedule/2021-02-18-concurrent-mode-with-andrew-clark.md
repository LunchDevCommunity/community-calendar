Live listen and discussion of Andrew Clark's [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com) episode on accessibility.  
This episode aired August 15th, 2019 and remains relevant to React developers today.

## Episode Summary

Today we kick off our first of 6 React Conf interviews.

We start with Andrew Clark to learn what this React Conf 2019 means for us â€” our libraries and apps.
He's a core team member who cut his React teeth on the fiber re-write and he's been deep in Concurrent React for 3 years.

We chat about future features, prerelease channels, and how Suspense is preparing the way for others to bring cooperative concurrency to their libraries, applications, and frameworks.
