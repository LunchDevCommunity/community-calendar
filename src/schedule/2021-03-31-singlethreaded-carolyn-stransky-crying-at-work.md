Each season, [single-threaded](https://anchor.fm/single-threaded/) tackles a new topic in software engineering. This first season, we're exploring feelings. Why do we like some technologies but dislike others? How do our emotions come into play with our career choices? These are some of the questions we'll be answering this season. Episodes are a mix of guest interviews and solo musings.

Join us on Wednesday, March 31 for a group listen of _single-threaded_. This week, [Jenn](https://twitter.com/gurlcode) and guest [Carolyn Stransky](https://twitter.com/carolstran) will discuss crying at work. We'll be listening together in the `live-event-voice` channel, and sharing our thoughts in the `#single-threaded` channel.
