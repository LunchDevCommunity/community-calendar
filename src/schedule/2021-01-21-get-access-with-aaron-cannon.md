## Episode Summary

This week, we talk accessibility pitfalls with Aaron Canon.

Aaron is the co-founder and chief accessibility engineer at Accessible360 â€” where he uses his experience as a blind developer to improve real-world accessibility for all citizens of the web.

He shares his first-hand experience on which practices work, which ones are bogus, where to focus our accessibility efforts, and which libraries provide the best starting point.

I learned a ton. You will too.
