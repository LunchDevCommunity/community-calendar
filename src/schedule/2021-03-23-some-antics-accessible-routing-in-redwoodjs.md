Routing in single-page applications can get _tricky_. You have to manage the user's focus, and you have to announce the new page to assistive technology users. There's so much room here for the tools and frameworks to help us get things right.

Join us for [Some Antics](https://twitch.tv/SomeAnticsDev) as [Anthony Campolo](https://twitter.com/ajcwebdev) and [Dom Saadi]() from the [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) Core Team walk [Ben](https://twitter.com/BenDMyers) through Redwood's components for accessible routing, as well as the principles that can empower your framework of choice to route accessibly.
