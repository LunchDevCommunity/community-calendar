Lunch devs create so much great content that it can be hard to find. Folks who want to watch previous events don't know when videos are released. Let's add a place for linkable summary posts with a recap of each week's content — a "lunch digest" if you will!

[lunch.dev](https://events.lunch.dev) uses [Eleventy](https://events.lunch.dev) to build server-side generate the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

To accomplish this mob job, we'll use [Eleventy Collections](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/] to add a "/posts" route.
