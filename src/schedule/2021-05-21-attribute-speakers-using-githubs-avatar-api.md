It's impossible to know [who's leading which event](https://github.com/LunchDevCommunity/community-calendar/issues/16) from the homepage. Event leader images make an event page more engaging and help new speaker show their face online. Let's add event leader images to event pages and cards using [GitHub Avatars](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22932422/get-github-avatar-from-email-or-name) API.

Here are some stretch goals:

- Add avatar collections to a card for multi-speaker events
- Add covered technology (may require adding images for technologies we cover)
- Add an event-leader collection page to showcase events by that leader/speaker
