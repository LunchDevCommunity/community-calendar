We've been learning a ton about Eleventy by building up https://events.lunch.dev/.
The next big project is creating "social cards".
We'll be adding them to the Eleventy site but the knowledge is totally transferrable to other places on the web.

We'll be learning too! So, no previous experience required just bring your curiosity :partying_face:
