**You know what they say… an SVG is worth a thousand words.**

A well-placed icon can communicate a lot in very little space. Ensuring that communication is accessible can be a challenge, however, especially as you scale up to a whole icon library.

Join us on [Some Antics](https://twitch.tv/someanticsdev), **Tuesday, February 16 at 10am PST**, as our guest, our very own [Michael "Chantastic" Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) walks us through his journey through building an accessible, reusable SVG icon library in React. It's going to be a great time.
