It's difficult find events by date on [lunch.dev](https://events.lunch.dev). Folks most often go there to find out [what's next or what's happening this week](https://github.com/LunchDevCommunity/community-calendar/issues/5). Let's add 'Next' and 'Later this week' sections to the home page using [Eleventy's custom filtering and sorting](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/#advanced-custom-filtering-and-sorting) APIs.
