### High-level takeaways

- TM: You can use TypeScript w/o TypeScript ðŸ¤¯
- VP: You can progressively adopt TypeScript tooling
- The power of [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)

### Additional takeaways

- MC: Love framing of "type-checking is spell-checking for code." It minimizes the intimidation of a new language while retaining the effectiveness
- TWM: Looking at the first example, I was thinking about all the bugs we humans miss in code review
- MC: TS is like a programming pair with perfect knowledge of JavaScript
- VP: TS is excellent at helping with tricky to spot typographical errors like pluralization. e.g., `CombidedDecision`, `combineDecisions`
- TWM/BM: We can use `//@ts-check` privately. We don't even have to check it into version control. Enable at and disable it locally as needed
- TWM: JS has types! It just doesn't care about them. You have to. "Weakly typed"
- [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com) shout out
- [WAT](https://destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), a lightning talk by Gary Bernhardt from CodeMash 2012
- MC: Do we have hope that we can sweep away the outdated practices with new ones? (the w3schools issue). New practices become legacy practices.
- BM: No. No hope ðŸ˜„. Because "we don't break the web". Compilers are a fixed point where we can say (use this compiler version). Closest thing in JS might be Node.js version
- BM: "Don't [burninate](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Burninate) Flash" <- If Ben was in charge of Flash marketing, we'd still have Flash
- TWM: jQuery support might be why Typescript won
