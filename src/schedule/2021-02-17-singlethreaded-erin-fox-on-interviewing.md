Erin Fox ([@erinfoox](https://twitter.com/erinfoox)) joins Jenn ([@gurlcode](https://twitter.com/gurlcode)) to talk about one of the most stressful parts of being a software developer: interviews. We talk about why interviewing in tech is nerve-racking, how to handle rejections and why, like dating, you should never commit too early.
