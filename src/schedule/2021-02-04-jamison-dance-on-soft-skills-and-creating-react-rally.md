Live listen and discussion of Jamison Dance's [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com) episode on soft skills and React Rally. This episode aired August 15, 2019 and remains relevant to React developers today.

## Episode Summary

This week we talk with [Jamison Dance](https://jamison.dance/) about the parts of programming that are distinctly non-technical.

We talk about the perfect TLD, working with a team, finding psychological safety, the organization of [React Rally](https://reactrally.com/), and how to recycle batteries.

Jamison is co-host of the podcast _Soft Skills Engineering_, where he and Dave Smith answer non-technical questions for technical folks. It's a great show that I highly recommend. Check it out at [softskills.audio](https://softskills.audio/).
