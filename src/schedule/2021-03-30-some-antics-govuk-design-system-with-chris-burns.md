Design systems are a powerful tool for making sure an organization leverages accessible practices consistently and reliably. This is especially important when you're a government trying to meet the needs of its constituents! The [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) is one such design system trying to solve these problems.

Join [Ben](https://twitter.com/BenDMyers) and their guest [Chris Burns](https://twitter.com/BurnedChris) on [Some Antics](https://twitch.tv/SomeAnticsDev), as they go through the GOV.UK Design System and see what makes it tick!
