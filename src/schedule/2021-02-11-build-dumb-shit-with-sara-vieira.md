Live listen and discussion of Sara Vieira's [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com) episode on mental health and developer advocacy. This episode aired October 31, 2019 and remains relevant to React developers today.

## Episode Summary

[Sara](https://iamsaravieira.com/) is a developer on the beloved [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) app. She's worked for years as a developer advocate, giving brilliant talks across the world, and building some of the wildest sites on the web.

Chantastic asks her about succeeding against mental illness, how she achieved meme status, why we should "build dumb shit," and what the heck a developer advocate does.

They discuss corporate "change the world" bullshit, casual racism, why you should teach what you know, and the shockingly unglamorous lifestyle of a conference speaker.
