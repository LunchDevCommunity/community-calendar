Web development tutorials often leave out accessibility best practices or even recommend inaccessible antipatterns. They have headings that are out of order, images without alt text, and more. **Join [Ben Myers](https://benmyers.dev) and his guest, our own [Anthony Campolo](https://twitter.com/ajcwebdev), as they dive into the [RedwoodJS tutorials](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/welcome-to-redwood) and figure out how they could better encourage accessible development from the start!**

[Some Antics](https://twitch.tv/SomeAnticsDev) is Ben's new, weekly Twitch stream, focusing on web accessibility, semantic markup, progressive enhancement, and other adventures in web development. You can expect rad guests and bad puns, **Tuesdays at 10am PST.**
