For this lunch session, [Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson) will take us on a tour of [Remix](https://remix.run), a new web framework for React from the authors of React Router. The session will be a hands-on demo, showing how Remix takes advantage of both time-honored techniques like server rendering and prefetching as well as more modern client-side state and optimistic UI updates to help you build fast, progressively-enhanced web apps.
