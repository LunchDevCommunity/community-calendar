Join us as [Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson) shows us how [Remix](https://remix.run) can help us build better websites.

Building a product is fun, but screwing around with build tools and data loading is not. Remix brings you the state of the art in web development (and then some) without leaving behind the fundamentals that make it great.

Built for the serverless era, and on top of our open source that runs in millions of projects already, Remix gives you a sturdy foundation to build better websites. You'll love the performance and productivity Remix's novel (and traditional) approach gives you.
