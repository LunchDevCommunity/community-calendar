Length: 13 minutes to trickle in + 10 min rule explanation + 60 minute breakout timer

When: Friday April 9 at 6:13pm MDT (7:13pm CST)

What: Adrianne will be online on the hour, but start reading the rules 13 minutes after the hour. Work in a team in the Discord #live-event channel to solve digital puzzles. General puzzle solving prowess and Taylor Swift acumen will both help the team! If you like one but not the other, youâ€™ll probably still have fun.
