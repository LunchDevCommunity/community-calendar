Live listen and discussion of Val Geisler's [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com) episode on communicating with your audience. This episode aired September 12th, 2019 and remains relevant to creators today.

## Episode Summary

This week we diverge from our typical technical focus to talk about communication.

Many of you are developing a product.
Whether that be an open source library,
course material on your favorite framework,
or your skills a freelance developer —
you are selling something.

Selling requires more than great technical skills.
It requires strong communication.

Today we sit with Val Geisler — founder of Fix My Churn.
We talk about communication thru email,  
Why it’s critical for building and branding your business,  
And how we get started.

I believe it has the potential to change your career.
