Design systems are a powerful tool for making sure an organization leverages accessible practices consistently and reliably. Accessibility can be baked into all you do, from the first principles of your design all the way out to whole experiences.

Join [Ben](https://twitter.com/BenDMyers) and their guest [Ashlae Nelms](https://twitter.com/AshlaeAnnNelms) on [Some Antics](https://twitch.tv/SomeAnticsDev), as
they explore how to build accessible design systems from the start.
