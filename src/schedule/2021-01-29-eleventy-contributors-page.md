Recently, we've begun recognizing contributions to this community calendar with the [`all-contributors`](https://allcontributors.org/) bot! However, we wanted to take it one step further, and recognize those contributors on this site, on a [`/contributors`](https://events.lunch.dev/contributors/) page. We could do it by handâ€¦ but where's the fun in that?

Join us, as we explore Eleventy's [global data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/) system to create a `/contributors` page that automatically updates any time we recognize a contributor!

Check out [Ben's pull request](https://github.com/LunchDevCommunity/community-calendar/pull/68) and [the deploy preview](https://deploy-preview-68--lunchdev-events.netlify.app/contributors/).
