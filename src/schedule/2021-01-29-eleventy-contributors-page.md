Recently, we've begun recognizing contributions to this community calendar with the [`all-contributors`](https://allcontributors.org/) bot! However, we wanted to take it one step further, and recognize those contributors on this site, on a `/contributors` page. We could do it by handâ€¦ but where's the fun in that?

Join us, as we explore Eleventy's [global data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/) system to create a `/contributors` page that automatically updates any time we recognize a contributor!
