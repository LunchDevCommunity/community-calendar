Justin Noel is teaching us how to build a UPC lookup service with Astro, Cloudflare Workers, Pages, and KV!

Channel: <https://twitch.tv/lunchdev>

Join us to learn how to:

- Use Cloudflare Pages to host a simple static HTML page as a "site"
- Use the Astro Static Site Generator to add vanilla JavaScript and more pages to the site
- Build a really simple "database" to hold fake product info
- Build an API using Cloudflare Workers to do database lookups on UPC bar codes and return product information
