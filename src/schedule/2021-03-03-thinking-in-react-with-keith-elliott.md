Keith Elliott talks through Thinking in React. He's creating an app, and capturing the journey in public (and he's just beginning the journey).

He'll walk us through basic React concepts and habits. The themes are centered around the [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) article on reactjs.org.
