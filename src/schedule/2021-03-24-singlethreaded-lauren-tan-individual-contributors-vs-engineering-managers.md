Each season, [single-threaded](https://anchor.fm/single-threaded/) tackles a new topic in software engineering. This first season, we're exploring feelings. Why do we like some technologies but dislike others? How do our emotions come into play with our career choices? These are some of the questions we'll be answering this season. Episodes are a mix of guest interviews and solo musings.

Join us on Wednesday, March 24 for a group listen of _single-threaded_. This week, [Jenn](https://twitter.com/gurlcode) and guest [Lauren Tan](https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_) will discuss career paths and compare being an individual contributor to being an engineering manager. We'll be listening together in the `live-event-voice` channel, and sharing our thoughts in the `#single-threaded` channel.
