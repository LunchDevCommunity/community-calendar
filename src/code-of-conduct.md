# Code of conduct

## Notes

### Considerations

- Careful not to penalize those participating in their non-native language with very nuanced language guidelines
- Recommended age: Communiting that the Server is moderated for children
- Usage of non-demeaning, non-agressive expletives being permissable but — preferrably — with intentionality and consideration
- Etiquette suggestions — examples made available for exceptionally (safety promoting) behavior
  - Requesting consent before DMing
  - Gently correcting first offenses of demeaning language and consent violating emoji (where usage seems unintended)
  - When providing help and solutions, respond with empathy. Everyone has different levels of experience, and may be looking for different things. Seek first to understand where the asker is coming from, and what they're looking for. Avoid minimizing the challenges the asker is facing — what's familiar for you is likely not familiar for them!
