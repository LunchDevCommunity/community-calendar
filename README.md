# 📅 Lunch.dev Community Calendar

Welcome to the **Lunch.dev Community Calendar**! This site shows off all of the cool things we've been doing in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/dx7ZWCy). It's built with a static site generator called [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).

## Sounds great! How do I run it?

First off, you'll want to clone it and install your dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LunchDevCommunity/community-calendar.git
cd community-calendar
npm install
```

Then, you'll want to decide whether you want to create a **one-off build** or spin up a **dev server** that updates whenever you make a change **(you probably want the dev server)**.

**One-off build:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**Dev server:**

```
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the site.

## Can I contribute?

Absolutely! We're using this community calendar as a way to learn these tools together, and that means open-sourcing it! We'll have more contribution information later, but in the meantime, if you have an idea for improvements, reach out [on the server](https://discord.gg/dx7ZWCy).
